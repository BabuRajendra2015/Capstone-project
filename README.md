# Project summary:
This project is about the behavioral analysis of logs taken from the music app, Sparkify. It is very interesting to analyze the user behavior which helps in the early detection of potential customer churn out.
The goal of the project is to identify the churn customers by analyzing the user behavior logs of the music app, sparkify. The user behavior is identified through the log attributes like playing song, adding friend, adding to play list, clicking on upgrade and downgrade buttons, clicking on cancel confirmation which ensure the customer is churn out customer. 
Encouraging these customers through various incentive schemes help the music companies to control the potential financial losses to a great extent. This project is executed through PySpark engine where the data can be processed and analyzed through easy spark sql queries. This is a big data project where the size of the data is 12 GB and a sub set of data is considered for the analysis.
